# Computer Vision Assignments
Here you can find the code I wrote during the Computer Vision and Photogrammetry course

Code of the first assignment includes:

-Simple operations in homogeneous coordinates
-Finding the points of infinity of a square and the the line of infinity. Then finding the points of intersection of the square diagonals with the line of infinity.
-Assuming pinhole camera we are using the collinearity condition to simulate the photograph taken of the square with a camera of 4912x3264 pixel. After that we calculate the vanishing points of the square in the simulated photograph.
